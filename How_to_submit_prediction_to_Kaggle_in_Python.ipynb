    "# Introduction\n",
    "Machine learning competitions are a great way to improve your skills and measure your progress as a data scientist. If you are using data from a competition on Kaggle, you can easily submit it from your notebook.  Here's how you do it.\n",
    "\n",

    "We're doing very minimal data set up here so we can focus on how to submit modeling results to competitions. Other tutorials will teach you how build great models. So the model in this example will be fairly simple. We'll start with the code to read data, select predictors, and fit a model."
