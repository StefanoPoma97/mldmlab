# # 6.5.1 Best Subset Selection
# 
# Here we apply the best subset selection approach to the Hitters data. We
# wish to predict a baseball playerâ€™s Salary on the basis of various statistics
# associated with performance in the previous year. Let's take a quick look:


hitters_df = pd.read_csv('Hitters.csv')
hitters_df.head()


# First of all, we note that the `Salary` variable is missing for some of the
# players. The `isnull()` function can be used to identify the missing observations. It returns a vector of the same length as the input vector, with a `TRUE` value
# for any elements that are missing, and a `FALSE` value for non-missing elements.
# The `sum()` function can then be used to count all of the missing elements:


print("Number of null values:", hitters_df["Salary"].isnull().sum())


# We see that `Salary` is missing for 59 players. The `dropna()` function
# removes all of the rows that have missing values in any variable:


# Print the dimensions of the original Hitters data (322 rows x 20 columns)
print("Dimensions of original data:", hitters_df.shape)

# Drop any rows the contain missing values, along with the player names
hitters_df_clean = hitters_df.dropna().drop('Player', axis=1)

# Print the dimensions of the modified Hitters data (263 rows x 20 columns)
print("Dimensions of modified data:", hitters_df_clean.shape)

# One last check: should return 0
print("Number of null values:", hitters_df_clean["Salary"].isnull().sum())



dummies = pd.get_dummies(hitters_df_clean[['League', 'Division', 'NewLeague']])

y = hitters_df_clean.Salary

# Drop the column with the independent variable (Salary), and columns for which we created dummy variables
X_ = hitters_df_clean.drop(['Salary', 'League', 'Division', 'NewLeague'], axis=1).astype('float64')

# Define the feature set X.
X = pd.concat([X_, dummies[['League_N', 'Division_W', 'NewLeague_N']]], axis=1)


# We can perform best subset selection by identifying the best model that contains a given number of predictors, where **best** is quantified using RSS. We'll define a helper function to outputs the best set of variables for
# each model size:


def processSubset(feature_set):
    # Fit model on feature_set and calculate RSS
    model = sm.OLS(y,X[list(feature_set)])
    regr = model.fit()
    RSS = ((regr.predict(X[list(feature_set)]) - y) ** 2).sum()
    return {"model":regr, "RSS":RSS}



def getBest(k):
    
    tic = time.time()
    
    results = []
    
    for combo in itertools.combinations(X.columns, k):
        results.append(processSubset(combo))
    
    # Wrap everything up in a nice dataframe
    models = pd.DataFrame(results)
    
    # Choose the model with the highest RSS
    best_model = models.loc[models['RSS'].argmin()]
    
    toc = time.time()
    print("Processed", models.shape[0], "models on", k, "predictors in", (toc-tic), "seconds.")
    
    # Return the best model, along with some other useful information about the model
    return best_model


# This returns a `DataFrame` containing the best model that we generated, along with some extra information about the model. Now we want to call that function for each number of predictors $k$:


# Could take quite awhile to complete...

models_best = pd.DataFrame(columns=["RSS", "model"])

tic = time.time()
for i in range(1,8):
    models_best.loc[i] = getBest(i)

toc = time.time()
print("Total elapsed time:", (toc-tic), "seconds.")


# Now we have one big `DataFrame` that contains the best models we've generated along with their RSS:


models_best


# If we want to access the details of each model, no problem! We can get a full rundown of a single model using the `summary()` function:


print(models_best.loc[2, "model"].summary())


# This output indicates that the best two-variable model
# contains only `Hits` and `CRBI`. To save time, we only generated results
# up to the best 7-variable model. You can use the functions we defined above to explore as many variables as are desired.


# Show the best 19-variable model (there's actually only one)
print(getBest(19)["model"].summary())


# Rather than letting the results of our call to the `summary()` function print to the screen, we can access just the parts we need using the model's attributes. For example, if we want the $R^2$ value:


models_best.loc[2, "model"].rsquared


# Excellent! In addition to the verbose output we get when we print the summary to the screen, fitting the `OLM` also produced many other useful statistics such as adjusted $R^2$, AIC, and BIC. We can examine these to try to select the best overall model. Let's start by looking at $R^2$ across all our models:


# Gets the second element from each row ('model') and pulls out its rsquared attribute
models_best.apply(lambda row: row[1].rsquared, axis=1)


# As expected, the $R^2$ statistic increases monotonically as more
# variables are included.
# 
# Plotting RSS, adjusted $R^2$, AIC, and BIC for all of the models at once will
# help us decide which model to select. Note the `type="l"` option tells `R` to
# connect the plotted points with lines:


plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 18, 'lines.markersize': 10})

# Set up a 2x2 grid so we can look at 4 plots at once
plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)

# We will now plot a red dot to indicate the model with the largest adjusted R^2 statistic.
# The argmax() function can be used to identify the location of the maximum point of a vector
plt.plot(models_best["RSS"])
plt.xlabel('# Predictors')
plt.ylabel('RSS')

# We will now plot a red dot to indicate the model with the largest adjusted R^2 statistic.
# The argmax() function can be used to identify the location of the maximum point of a vector

rsquared_adj = models_best.apply(lambda row: row[1].rsquared_adj, axis=1)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 2)
plt.plot(rsquared_adj)
plt.plot(rsquared_adj.argmax(), rsquared_adj.max(), "or")
plt.xlabel('# Predictors')
plt.ylabel('adjusted rsquared')

# We'll do the same for AIC and BIC, this time looking for the models with the SMALLEST statistic
aic = models_best.apply(lambda row: row[1].aic, axis=1)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 3)
plt.plot(aic)
plt.plot(aic.argmin(), aic.min(), "or")
plt.xlabel('# Predictors')
plt.ylabel('AIC')

bic = models_best.apply(lambda row: row[1].bic, axis=1)

plt.subplot(2, 2, 4)
plt.plot(bic)
plt.plot(bic.argmin(), bic.min(), "or")
plt.xlabel('# Predictors')
plt.ylabel('BIC')


# Recall that in the second step of our selection process, we narrowed the field down to just one model on any $k<=p$ predictors. We see that according to BIC, the best performer is the model with 6 variables. According to AIC and adjusted $R^2$ something a bit more complex might be better. Again, no one measure is going to give us an entirely accurate picture... but they all agree that a model with 5 or fewer predictors is insufficient.

# # 6.5.2 Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection
# We can also use a similar approach to perform forward stepwise
# or backward stepwise selection, using a slight modification of the functions we defined above:


def forward(predictors):

    # Pull out predictors we still need to process
    remaining_predictors = [p for p in X.columns if p not in predictors]
    
    tic = time.time()
    
    results = []
    
    for p in remaining_predictors:
        results.append(processSubset(predictors+[p]))
    
    # Wrap everything up in a nice dataframe
    models = pd.DataFrame(results)
    
    # Choose the model with the highest RSS
    best_model = models.loc[models['RSS'].argmin()]
    
    toc = time.time()
    print("Processed ", models.shape[0], "models on", len(predictors)+1, "predictors in", (toc-tic), "seconds.")
    
    # Return the best model, along with some other useful information about the model
    return best_model


# Now let's see how much faster it runs!


models_fwd = pd.DataFrame(columns=["RSS", "model"])

tic = time.time()
predictors = []

for i in range(1,len(X.columns)+1):    
    models_fwd.loc[i] = forward(predictors)
    predictors = models_fwd.loc[i]["model"].model.exog_names

toc = time.time()
print("Total elapsed time:", (toc-tic), "seconds.")


# Phew! That's a lot better. Let's take a look:


print(models_fwd.loc[1, "model"].summary())
print(models_fwd.loc[2, "model"].summary())


# We see that using forward stepwise selection, the best one-variable
# model contains only `Hits`, and the best two-variable model additionally
# includes `CRBI`. Let's see how the models stack up against best subset selection:


print(models_best.loc[6, "model"].summary())
print(models_fwd.loc[6, "model"].summary())


# For this data, the best one-variable through six-variable
# models are each identical for best subset and forward selection.
# 
# # Backward Selection
# Not much has to change to implement backward selection... just looping through the predictors in reverse!


def backward(predictors):
    
    tic = time.time()
    
    results = []
    
    for combo in itertools.combinations(predictors, len(predictors)-1):
        results.append(processSubset(combo))
    
    # Wrap everything up in a nice dataframe
    models = pd.DataFrame(results)
    
    # Choose the model with the highest RSS
    best_model = models.loc[models['RSS'].argmin()]
    
    toc = time.time()
    print("Processed ", models.shape[0], "models on", len(predictors)-1, "predictors in", (toc-tic), "seconds.")
    
    # Return the best model, along with some other useful information about the model
    return best_model



models_bwd = pd.DataFrame(columns=["RSS", "model"], index = range(1,len(X.columns)))

tic = time.time()
predictors = X.columns

while(len(predictors) > 1):  
    models_bwd.loc[len(predictors)-1] = backward(predictors)
    predictors = models_bwd.loc[len(predictors)-1]["model"].model.exog_names

toc = time.time()
print("Total elapsed time:", (toc-tic), "seconds.")


# For this data, the best one-variable through six-variable
# models are each identical for best subset and forward selection.
# However, the best seven-variable models identified by forward stepwise selection,
# backward stepwise selection, and best subset selection are different:


print("------------")
print("Best Subset:")
print("------------")
print(models_best.loc[7, "model"].params)



print("-----------------")
print("Foward Selection:")
print("-----------------")
print(models_fwd.loc[7, "model"].params)



print("-------------------")
print("Backward Selection:")
print("-------------------")
print(models_bwd.loc[7, "model"].params)
